SYSLINUX

SYSLINUX is a collection of bootloaders

Installation:
SYSLINUX C:
COPY MEMDISK C:\
COPY CHAIN.C32 C:\
COPY MENU.C32 C:\

When booting and presented with command line, type
CHAIN.C32 FREEDOS=KERNEL.SYS

Alternatively, create a SYSLINUX.CFG, read documentation carefully for that!
(in below example, a "CONTENTS" directory with within it, ISOLINUX directory,
 with within it, the ISOLINUX.BIN CDROM bootloader - non-emulation style.
 please be aware to use "/" and "\" exactly as below!
 
For MEMDISK and ISOLINUX, please read documentation carefully!:
* mkisofs -b isolinux/freedos.img -o c:\cdtest\cd1.iso contents 
* mkisofs -no-emul-boot -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -o c:\cdtest\cd1.iso contents 

Alternatives for CDRECORD (which includes MKISOFS) are XORRISO and CDRKIT
(see http://sites.google.com/site/blairdude/cdrkit for DOS port)
