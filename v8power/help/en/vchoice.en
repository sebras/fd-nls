vchoice [options]

Choose an option.

It returns an errorlevel of choice selected based on its entry number. Not
the letter/number of the choice. For example, if the second item is chosen,
it will return an errorlevel of 2. Regardless of any prefix (Like C, 1, R, etc).
Also, I personally recommend using auto for any set of choices that
you prefix with a letter or number.

    [none]      Perform using all automatic defaults settings.</td></tr>
    /A n        Set text attribute to n for selected item.
    /B color    Set the background text attribute to color (or a value) for
                selected item.
    /F color    Set the foreground text attribute to color (or a value) for
                selected item.
    /D n        Preselect item number n as the default choice.
    type        Direct key press selection type.
                    off     Select with only arrow keys.
                    auto    Detect direct jump characters. (Default)
                    alpha   Jump to selections using A-Z.
                    digit   Jump to selections using 1-9 (+0).
    /Q          Query for result. When the choice is made, it's text will be
                sent to STDOUT.
    /T seconds  Delay in seconds before the default item is automatically
                selected (0-3600). Note that even if the user navigates to a
                different item, the original default item will be selected when
                the timeout is achieved.
    /P n        Use polling mode and preselect item number n as the current
                choice. Note, any change of selection will exit vchoice and
                return 100+ the current choice number.
    /K n        Use n instead of frame character to detect bounds.
    CTRL-C      When specified and Control-C is pressed, will exit with
                errorlevel of 200.
