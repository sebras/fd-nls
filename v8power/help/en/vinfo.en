More options that are mostly only useful for programmers and R&D. They have
been available for a while. But are not officially (by me) part of the
V8Power Tools API and may change or be removed at anytime. But since I use
some of them, maybe they'll get moved into their own utilities.
    ASCII       Display entire ASCII table
    RAM         Dump all of conventional memory to StdOut.
    /C *        output ASCII values for remainder of command line
    /R string   Search all of conventional memory for string
    /U string   Search memory (a000:0000 and up) for case insensitive string
    /J pos *    Return the ASCII value of the character in pos on the remainder
                of the command line as an errorlevel. 0 is returned if the
                position was not found.
