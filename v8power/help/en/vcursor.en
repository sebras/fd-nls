vcursor [options]

Change or query the cursor size and shape.

    [none]      Outputs the current cursor shape to STDOUT.
    n           Set the current cursor shape as n.
    HIDE        Hides the cursor.
    SMALL       Sets a small cursor.
    HALF        Sets the cursor to 1/2 of the text height.
    FULL        Sets the cursor to the full height of text.

Note: Although this utility is fully compatible with DOSBox, there is no
way to store the current cursor shape. See the examples, on how to work
around this issue. Also, this utility will not have any effect in a
Windows terminal.
